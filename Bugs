BUG 1 (2010.07.23)

If building new NSE dataset, np_table.c might be temporarily erased,
and entire code fail to build. 


Workaround:
Required NSE_pn_table_parser should be created as follows:
gcc NSE_pn_table_parser.c -o NSE_pn_table_parser

Then, re-create missing file "np_table.c":
NSE_pn_table_parser >np_table.c


BUG 2

NSE_enum called with position larger than total number of nuclides cause
crash.

Workaround:
Check for n<Nmax manually in your code.
