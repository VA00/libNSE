Source moved to GitHub repository. To compile:
git clone 
autoreconf -vif
./configure
make distcheck


2012.08.17 (AO)

Numerous minor changes and bugfixes:

- dependence on libinterp removed from configure.ac, because
NSE interpolation requires on-fly grid construction,
and only trilinear_interp_unit_cube() has been used - but this is just a single
line of code. Now it is incuded as "inline" function directly in the code.

- improvements in NSE_pn_table_generator.nb:
a) Generation of the partition function table takes a lot of time,
so now it is generated one nuclei by one and stored on disk. You can
stop and resume calculations later.

b) minor bugs: isotope list must include protons and neutron !

c) Ye=0 and Ye=1 are included by default with Xp=0, Xn=1 and
Xp=1, Xn=0, respectively.


- NSE_pn_table_parser.c :

Design error: to create new np_table.c you must recompile with new
nse_tbl.h, but old is still installed. Now this util is not compiled
automatically. You must do this manually:
gcc NSE_pn_table_parser.c -o NSE_pn_table_parser
 

- nse.c

Now all grids (Ye, rho, and T9) are arbitrary user-supplied tables.
In practice rho and T9 are still regular grids, but it is not obligatory.
In astrophysics, one frequently uses irregular spacig for e.g. T9. Accordingly,
fixed steps (delta_lg_rho_nse, delta_kT_nse) removed from the code.



2010.09.10 (AO)
Added trilinear interpolation for NSE,
NSE_enum_trilinear()

This require libinterp, recently forked
from psns2, compiled and installed.
The ./configure script should detect this;
is libinterp is not found legacy
staircase interpolation for Ye + bilinear
for T9-rho mix is used:
NSE_enum_staircase()
